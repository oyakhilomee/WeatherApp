A simple weather application built using the OpenWeatherMap API.

I wrote an article about how I built it, you should check it out [here](https://lifeofoyas.tech/how-to-create-a-simple-weather-app)

Used Michael Lynch's [JQuery plugin](https://github.com/michael-lynch/open-weather) to display the data from the API.
